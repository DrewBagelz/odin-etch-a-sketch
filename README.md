# odin-etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project.

## Overview

A grid that incrementally darkens its cells on mouseover, similar to
the classic "Etch a Sketch."

## Reflections

I didn't have much trouble with this project and was able to easily
find answers to any questions I did have with a little bit of
Googling. The only thing that gave me grief was how to increment the
opacity on every mouseover, but it turns out I was just overthinking
the solution. I should have committed more often, as I pretty much
just left this project open in a save-state on my virtual machine
for the entire duration of my working on it.
